# Audio-Deepfake-Detection-using-AI
Biometric Fraud: Deepfakes account for 40% of biometric fraud cases.
Project Goal: Develop an AI model to detect deepfake audio.
Converts audio to a spectrogram for analysis.
Uses a trained model to classify audio as Real or Fake.
Provides a confidence score and performance metrics.
Built with Flask and TensorFlow Lite for efficiency.

# Project Overview

+ Data set:ASVspoof 2019 dataset containing genuine and spoof audio recordings.
+ Preprocessing: Convert audio files to Mel spectrograms.
+ Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with classification layers.
+ Training: Binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, monitoring metrics.
+ Evaluation: Precision,recall Accuracy, F1 score.
+ Visualization: Model architecture visualization using plot_model
